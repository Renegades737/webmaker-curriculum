                  This course has a
                  focus on trying to engage students who may not be immediately drawn
                  to computer coding. The process of building engagement takes several
                  forms including:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Linking with
                      real world activities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use of popular
                      culture
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use of games
                      (offline and online)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use of silly
                      characters, fruits and animals
                    </li>

                <h2> Drama Games </h2>

                <p>
                  Drama games are an
                  effective way to break ice, encourage creative thinking and increase the connections between
                  participants. While it can seem like a bit of a risk I would strongly
                  encourage their use in both community and more formal settings.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Drama games are not explicitly included in-line for each lesson. Instead there is list of
                  ones that you may find useful here. You can probably see how they could be linked to specific lessons. Word games can be a useful one
                  for groups where it is not appropriate to be moving around.

                <h2> Adverb Exit </h2>

                <p>
                  This game is a good
                  icebreaker to get people thinking and lively.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Someone picks a
                  letter - A, B, C etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Then someone else
                  has to leave the room in a way that matches the letter.
                </p>

                <p>
                  ie, They choose an
                  adverb that begins with that letter.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A - Anxiously, C - Cheerfully, M - Messily

                  Aim To memorise an
                  ever-expanding list, in sequence.
                </p>

                <p>
                  How to play: A
                  straightforward memory game that requires you to memorise an
                  ever-expanding list. You can play in a large group or with just two
                  people. Player 1 starts off: &quot;I went to market and I bought ...
                  a loaf of bread.&quot; Player 2 continues, adding their own item to
                  the list: &quot;I went to market and bought a loaf of bread and a
                  bunch of bananas.&quot; Player 3: &quot;I went to market and I bought
                  a loaf of bread, a bunch of bananas and some fish.&quot; And so on.
                  Items must be repeated in the correct order. If someone makes a
                  mistake, they are out. Last one standing wins.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you don’t like
                  I went to market then customise your list to suit the company. &quot;I

                <p>
                  The  tours of Katy Perry are always a bit crazy with different names,
                  dances, animals, characters, outfits and concepts they include:
                </p>

                <ul>

                  Can you think of a
                  crazy, colourful name for a new tour. It could include fruit,
                  colours, animals, types of dancing, shapes, names.

                <p>
                  At the end of the game, let’s see what ones we can remember and write them down.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is a Mozilla
                  favourite but one that I’ve used in school before to free up the
                  atmosphere especially when teaching a new group. Follow the instructions here.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This works well
                  right at the beginning of a course to get the energy going. You can
                  use it as a way of getting background knowledge about past work
                  people have done in the area or knowledge of key words and concepts
                  too.

                  Another Mozilla
                  favourite is the <a href ="https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/how-to-hack-the-robot-dance">How to Hack the Robot Dance activity</a>. This is a silly and fun
                  way to introduce the programmming concept of proceedural, sequential programming.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each thing that is
                  done as part of the dance is an instruction.
                  This can link to the
                  need for exact instructions, the definition of algorithms etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In our course this
                  links to the way we create web pages. It is done line by line and we
                  need to make sure our instructions are exact and in the right order.

                <h2> Round Singing </h2>

                <p>
                  A round is a musical
                  composition in which a minimum of three voices sing exactly the same
                  melody  but with each voice beginning at different times so that
                  different parts of the melody coincide but nevertheless fit
                  harmoniously together.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Try out some round
                  singing with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A8re_Jacques">three parts like Frere Jacques</a>.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                  And then maybe try
                  one out with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row,_Row,_Row_Your_Boat">four parts like Row your boat</a>.

                <p>
                  This activity can be
                  a fun way to introduce the subject of loops in programming.
                </p>
                <h2> Ground Hog Day Loop
                / Forum Theatre </h2>
                <p>
                  Watch <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSVeDx9fk60">the Ground Hog day trailer and share the core concept.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following game is a simplified version of forum theatre. You need a joker/ facilitator who sets up
                  the action and sets up a scenario and two or more actors who act it out. Each actor gets their first instructions from the facilitator. And is told to improvise
                </p>
                <p>
                  When the action gets stuck the facilitator shouts Freeze and the actor go limp and look like they have falled asleep. The facilitator tell the actors to go
                  get instructions on what to do differently from their "Brains". The brains are a small group of other students who tell the actors what to do next to change the scenario.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You have a limited number of characters. Each character has to start the scene in a particular way. And each character has goal that they have to make happen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a facilitator you can should start the scene with characters with different end
                  conditions or goals that cannot be resolved. Later you should alter the conditions so that both end conditions can be met and the
                  scene can be resolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An example: There is an situation where a parent is about to see a teenager go out for the night.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The teenager wants to stay out all night at a friends house but doesn’t want to tell the parent where they are going. You can’t leave until this is
                  resolved.
                <p>
                  The parent doesn’t want their child to stay out past 10 o’clock and wants to know
                  where they will be. You won’t let the your child leave without agreeing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The facilitator should start and stop the action and send the actors back to their brains to try out different scenarios. If you are doing your job right
                  each actor and brain should be able try different things out but not be able to resolve the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When it seems appropriate, the facilitator should reshape the goals of the actors slightly to allow a resolution. Tell the child  - "You will come back but not before 12. But you must fight to stay out later."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tell the parent - "You will let your child go out till 12. But you must fight to get them to come back earlier."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Recap what happened with the group. Why did the loop keep happening? How was it resolved in the end?
                </p>
                <p>
                  What about Ground Hog Day. What was the end condition? The main character had to give up his selfishness.
